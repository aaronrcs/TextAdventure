# TextAdventure

An 8 x 8 game map on which an adventurer is placed (randomly). 
-The goal of the adventurer is to exit the game with two prizes. 
-The adventurer moves one square at a time (left, right, up down) and encounters either an obstacle (can't move there), a prize, or a challenge. 
-The challenge involves asking the user if they want to take the challenge or back out. 

Challenges involve a hazard or monster who holds the prize. 
One of two outcomes can happen: 

  1) The adventurer takes damage. 
  2) The adventurer inflicts damage on monster or hazard.

--> The game ends either if the player finds the goal with two prizes in hand (a win) or dies (all hit points are gone --- lose).
